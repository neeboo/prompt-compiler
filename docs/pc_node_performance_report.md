# PC Node Performance Analysis Report

*Generated: August 6, 2025*

## üéØ Overview

This report provides a detailed analysis of PC Node's Context Sharing functionality performance across different scenarios. Through comparative testing, it demonstrates the efficiency improvements and cost savings achieved by this feature in both single-agent and multi-agent environments.

## üìä Test Overview

### Testing Methodology

We conducted two main types of comparative tests:

1. **Single-Agent Multi-turn Conversation Test (20 rounds)**
   - Without Context Sharing (transmitting complete message history)
   - With Context Sharing (using semantic compression)

2. **Multi-Agent Multi-turn Conversation Test (20 rounds)**
   - Without Context Sharing (transmitting all chat records)
   - With Context Sharing (using semantic compression)

### Core Testing Metrics

- **Token Usage**: Measures the size of transmitted data
- **Compression Ratio**: Effectiveness of Context Sharing compression
- **Cost Efficiency**: Cost savings calculations based on API calls
- **Response Time**: Time efficiency of request processing
